Preheat oven to 350 Degree and Prepare three 8’ inch cake pans with non-stick baking spray
and parchment paper in the bottom. Add the Flour, Sugar, Cocoa, Baking Soda, Baking Powder
and Salt to a Large mixing bowl and combine and set aside.

Add the milk, oil, vanilla, extract and eggs to a medium size bowl and combine.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat until well combined. 

Slowly add the hot water to the batter and mix on low speed until well combined. Scrape down
the sides of the bowl as needed to make sure everything is well combined.

Divide batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake for 22-25 minutes, or until a
toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.

Remove Cakes from oven and allow to cool for 2-3 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack to
finish cooling.

To make the coconut filling, add the shredded coconut and sweetened condensed milk to a
medium bowl and stir to combine. Set aside.

To make the frosting, cream the butter and shortening in a large mixer bowl and mix together
until well combined.

Add the Coconut extract.

Slowly add remaining powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Add water or milk, as needed.

To build the cake, use a large serrated knife to remove the tops of the cake layers so that
they’re flat.

Place the first Cake Layer on a serving plate or cardboard cake circle then pipe a dam of coconut
filling inside of the dam, then spread evenly into an even layer.

Sprinkle 1-2 Tablespoons of Slivered almonds over the top and press into the filling.

Add the next cake layer, then top it with another dam of frosting, the remaining coconut filling
and more slivered almonds.

Add the final cake layer to the top of cake.

Smooth out the frosting on the top sides of the cake.

Set the cake aside and make the chocolate ganache. Put the Chocolate chips in a heat proof
bowl.

Microwave the heavy whipping cream until it just begins to boil, then pour it over the chocolate
chips. Allow it to sit for 2-3 minutes, then whisk until smooth.

Use a squeeze bottle or a spoon to drizzle the chocolate around the edge of the cake, then fill in
the top of the cake and smooth it with an offset spatula.

Allow the Ganache to firm a bit, about 10 minutes, then top with remaining frosting, a little
more shredded coconut, almond Slivers and Almond Joy Candy Bars.
